# Making A Game: Pong-Around (Step 1)

This is a set of workshop files for writing (parts of) a JS + `<canvas>` Pong-style game called "Pong Around".

The workshop is organized into multiple steps, each in their own branch:

* [Step 1](../step-1/README.md): adding the paddles
* [Step 2](../step-2/README.md): adding the ball
* [Step 3](../step-3/README.md): bouncing and speeding up the ball
* [Step 4](../step-4/README.md): keeping score
* [Final](../final/README.md): final solution branch

Go through the steps in order, and compare your code to the beginning of each next-step before moving on, to make sure you're getting everything in the right place.

## Extra Credit

Things you can consider adding to this game to make it more fun to play:

* Make the paddles shorten little by little as the number of bounces increases
* Add an extra obstacle (of any shape) in the middle of the board after a certain number of bounces
* Add "multi-ball" mode, where the game adds another ball after a certain number of bounces
